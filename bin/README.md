# Merkle
Merkle tree and other data structures.

## Install
```bash
$ npm install @guildofweavers/merkle --save
```

## Example
```TypeScript
import { MerkleTree } from '@guildofweavers/merkle';

// create an array of values to put into a tree
const values = [
    Buffer.from('a'),
    Buffer.from('b'),
    Buffer.from('c'),
    Buffer.from('d')
];

// create a Merkle tree
const tree = MerkleTree.create(values, 'sha256');

// create a proof for the second position in the tree (value 'b')
const proof = tree.prove(1);
console.log(proof[0].toString()); // 'b'

// verify the proof
const result = MerkleTree.verify(tree.root, 1, proof, 'sha256');
console.log(result); // true
```

## API
You can find complete API definitions in [merkle.d.ts](/merkle.d.ts). Here is a quick overview of the provided functionality:

### Creating Merkle trees
You can use two methods to create a Merkle Tree from a list of values:

* static **create**(values: `Buffer[]`, hashAlgorithm: `string`): `MerkleTree`
* static **createAsync**(values: `Buffer[]`, hashAlgorithm: `string`): `Promise<MerkleTree>`

Both methods take an array of values and a name of the hash algorithm to use when building the tree. Currently, the following hash algorithms are supported:

* `sha256` - Node's native implementation of SHA256 algorithm.
* `blake2s256` - Node's native implementation of Blake2s algorithm for 256-bit output.
* `wasmBlake2s256` - WebAssembly-based implementation of Blake2s algorithm for 256-bit output.

**Note:** async method is currently just a placeholder. All it does is call the sync version and returns the result.

### Creating Merkle proofs
Once you have a tree, you can use it to prove that a value is located at a certain index like so:

* **prove**(index: `number`): `Buffer[]`<br />
  The returned proof is an array which has the values as the first element, and nodes comprising the proof as all other elements.

You can also create a proof for many indexes at the same time:

* **proveBatch**(indexes: `number[]`): `BatchMerkleProof`<br />
  The resulting proof is compressed. So, if you need to prove membership of multiple values, this is a much more efficient approach.
  
  Batch proof has the following form:

```TypeScript
interface BatchMerkleProof {
    values  : Buffer[];
    nodes   : Buffer[][];
    depth   : number;
}
```
where, `values` are the leaves located at the indexes covered by the proof, `nodes` are the internal nodes that form the actual proof, and `depth` is the depth of the source tree.

### Verifying Merkle proofs
Once you have a proof, you can verify it against a tree root like so:

* static **verify**(root: `Buffer`, index: `number`, proof: `Buffer[]`, hashAlgorithm: `string`): `boolean`<br />
  This will return `true` if the value located at the first position in the `proof` array is indeed located at the specified `index` in the tree.

For the batched version use:

* static **verifyBatch**(root: `Buffer`, indexes: `number[]`, proof: `BatchMerkleProof`, hashAlgorithm: `string`): `boolean`<br />
  Similarly to single-index version, this will return `true` if the values in `proof.values` are indeed located at the specified `indexes` in the tree.

## Performance
Some very informal benchmarks run on Intel Core i5-7300U @ 2.60GHz (single thread) for generating a tree out of 2<sup>20</sup> values:

| Hash Algorithm | Time    |
| -------------- | ------- |
| sha256         | 3.5 sec |
| blake2s256     | 3.2 sec |
| wasmBlake2s256 | 800 ms  |

**Note:** while `wasmBlake256` is much faster at hashing small values (i.e. 32-64 bytes), it is slower at hashing large values. For example, when hashing 1KB values, Node's native implementation of Blake2s is about 30% faster.
